# Setup

## 1. Python
(for Windows; https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

1.1. Go to https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6.exe then scroll down to Files. Click on the yellow link if your system is 32 bit (Figure 1). Click on the green link if your system is 64 bit. If you don’t know, choose the yellow link (most newer systems are 64 bit; check by pressing windows key and searching “system properties” and look for either “64-bit or x86”. If it's x86, then it is 32 bit).

1.2. Run the executable. Make sure to check the box “Add Python to PATH” during installation.
